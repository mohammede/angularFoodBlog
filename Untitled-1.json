    "content": "Biscotti might technically be a cookie, but once you have your first bite you'll remember how far it is from the soft, chewy Christmas cookies you normally make.<br> They are first baked in a large flat log, then cut and baked once more for perfectly toasted and crunchy treats.<br> They are made for dipping into coffee or another favorite hot drink.<br> We think of them as an acceptable excuse to eat cookies for breakfast, but also love them as an afternoon and after dinner treat.<br> Clearly, we can eat them any time of day. <br>What is biscotti?<br>The twice-baked Italian cookies originate from the city of Prato.<br> Unlike most cookies that form a dough that gets sliced or cut out, biscotti bakes in two oblong-shaped logs.<br>How do you bake biscotti?<br>Simple: You make your dough, form it into two logs, and bake those.<br> Once they're completely cool—this is an important step!—you slice them with a serrated knife at a slight angle and bake again.",
